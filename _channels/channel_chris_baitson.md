## Photography Philosophy

**Skill Over Gear**: Chris emphasizes that the quality of your photos depends more on your skill and creativity than on your equipment. The camera doesn't think, plan, or care about the shot - it simply follows the photographer's instructions.

**The Right Time Matters Most**: Being out at sunrise with any camera will yield better results than expensive gear used at the wrong time of day.

**Persistence Pays Off**: Returning to the same location multiple times offers new opportunities to capture different lighting, weather conditions, and compositions.

**Invest in Yourself**: Rather than obsessing over the latest gear, photographers should focus on developing their skills, learning fundamentals, practicing regularly, and developing their unique style.

## M43 Advocacy

Chris is particularly known for his videos explaining the practical advantages of Micro Four Thirds, especially regarding depth of field control in landscape photography. He challenges the full-frame superiority narrative by showing what M43 does differently (and often better) for specific applications.
