Growing up in Chalon sur Saône, France - the birthplace of Nicéphore Niépce and the first photograph - she brings a deep appreciation for photography's heritage while embracing modern computational features. Her "Cinderella story" with the OM-D E-M1 Mark II resonates with many photographers who find the perfect camera fit.

## Photography Journey

**Late Start with Big Impact**: Despite growing up in the birthplace of photography, Emilie only discovered her passion in 2018 when she joined a local camera club. What started as a hobby quickly became an all-consuming passion.

**The "Cinderella Story"**: In summer 2019, Emilie borrowed an OM-D E-M1 Mark II at a conference. As she describes it: "As soon as I held it in my hands, it was a perfect fit and instant love. I understand this sounds cheesy but it really was a Cinderella story." She switched from her previous system and never looked back.

**Philosophy**: "The best camera is the one you can carry everywhere without feeling that it is too heavy or that you will have to choose between wildlife or macro when heading out on a walk."

## Specializations

**Water Drop Refraction**: Emilie has become particularly known for her water drop refraction photography - capturing background subjects reflected and refracted through foreground water droplets. This technique showcases the optical physics of light passing through different mediums.

**Macro Photography**: Featured by Fstoppers for her article on why Micro Four Thirds is a "secret weapon" for macro work, emphasizing depth of field advantages, IBIS benefits, and computational features like in-camera focus stacking.

**Bird Photography**: Featured in two B&H Photo series (winter birding and Coast of New England birding), Emilie teaches comprehensive bird photography from settings to composition and storytelling.

**Night Sky Photography**: Utilizing OM System's advanced features for astrophotography.

## OM System Ambassador

As an official OM System Ambassador, Emilie:
- Creates educational content on OM System's official channels
- Speaks at photography festivals and events
- Teaches workshops at OM System Summer School
- Participates in live streams discussing new camera features

## The Break Free Program

Emilie participated in Olympus's Break Free Program with mentor Lee Hoy. Her project documented wildlife inhabiting a pond beyond a New Hampshire state highway, showcasing her ability to find extraordinary subjects in ordinary locations. She credits Lee Hoy's mentorship for pushing her to experiment and find new angles.

## Teaching Philosophy

**From her educator background**: "My tip would be the same tip I give to my students: if you start dreaming in your target language, that means that something has clicked and you are on your way to fluency. I believe it is the same for photography. You need to practice every day until your camera becomes an extension of your hand and eye."

**On the Olympus/OM System Community**: "You can always trust the Olympus family to help you through your journey and reach your goal. Everybody in the Olympus family wants you to succeed and is ready to answer questions and inspire you as well as provide excellent photography advice."

## Advocacy for Micro Four Thirds

Emilie is vocal about M43 advantages, particularly for macro work:
- **Depth of Field**: Smaller sensor provides more DOF at same aperture
- **Magnification**: 2x crop factor gives more detail in-frame
- **IBIS**: Strong stabilization enables handheld shooting at high magnifications
- **Computational Features**: In-camera focus stacking, high-res mode, Live Composite
- **Portability**: Lighter gear means more time shooting, less fatigue
