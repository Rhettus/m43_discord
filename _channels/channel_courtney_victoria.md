Her determination to connect with Britain's wild landscapes after returning from South Korea has resulted in compelling content that inspires others to explore their own local environments.

## Photography Philosophy

"I could never have predicted that I would find joy in making videos or that I would teach photography. I think 16-year-old me would be relieved to find out that I finally found the medium to channel my creativity through, and positively shocked that it has developed into a career."

Courtney hopes to inspire others with her take on nature and photography while continuing to develop her own skills and challenge the way she sees the world.

## Journey Highlights

**South Korea Years (2019-2020)**: "If I had to describe the four years I lived abroad in South Korea, I would say it felt like a different life. It was very different to what I had experienced in the previous 25 years of my life, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning and adapting to new culture, speaking another language, and exploring landscapes that are so rich in history."

**Return to UK**: As Courtney made the difficult decision to leave South Korea during the 2020 pandemic and move back to the UK, she was determined to continue exploring landscape photography, but this time with the aim of connecting more with the wild landscapes of Britain.
