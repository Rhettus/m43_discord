## Photography Journey & Evolution

**30+ Years with Olympus/OM System**: Guido has used many different Olympus camera models throughout his journey, currently shooting with the OM System OM-1 Mark II and a wide variety of Olympus and OM System lenses.

**Career Shift**: What started as a lifelong dream became reality when Guido turned professional. His YouTube channel, launched in 2022, grew rapidly as people worldwide connected with his authentic approach and stunning imagery.

**Evolution of Focus**: Guido's photography has evolved from primarily wildlife and bird photography in earlier years to a deep focus on landscape photography - the stillness, mood, and play of light and shadow across vast spaces.

## Personal Story: Out of the Darkness

A few years ago, illness and depression cast a long shadow over Guido's life. He reached rock bottom, losing direction and feeling everything collapse around him. But photography became his lifeline - picking up his camera again gave him a way to reconnect with the world. Through sharing his process on YouTube, showing not only final images but the complete journey of capturing them, he slowly rediscovered joy in creating.

This deeply personal journey is chronicled in his 2025 book "Out of the Darkness" - a 136-page hardback featuring his favorite photographs, each paired with the story behind the image, woven together with his personal journey of resilience and rediscovering purpose.

## Photography Philosophy

Inspired by David Attenborough's films and documentaries his whole life, Guido believes that being able to see, hear, and feel nature is the best way to live. Photography is his way of getting out there and experiencing nature firsthand - capturing essence, emotion, and narrative in each image.

**On Landscape Photography**: "Landscape photos are often made at sunrise or sunset because that's when the soft light occurs, but as always there are exceptions if you think differently. You can make your landscape photos everywhere, even in big cities there is always a nice view to be photographed."

## Global Impact

Guido's influence extends far beyond the Netherlands. Photographers from Belgium to around the world cite his videos as "very inspiring" and the catalyst for their decision to switch to OM System. His honest approach to both the technical and emotional aspects of photography resonates with viewers at all skill levels.
