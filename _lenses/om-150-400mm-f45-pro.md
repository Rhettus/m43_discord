## Overview

The OM System 150-400mm f/4.5 PRO is the flagship super-telephoto zoom for the M43 system, providing an incredible 300-800mm equivalent focal length. With a built-in 1.25x teleconverter that extends reach to 187-500mm (375-1000mm equivalent), this lens is the ultimate wildlife and sports photography tool for M43.

## Key Features

- 150-400mm zoom (300-800mm equivalent)
- Built-in 1.25x teleconverter extends to 187-500mm (375-1000mm equivalent)

- Advanced optical stabilization rated up to 6 stops
- Weather-sealed PRO construction

## Optical Performance

This is OM System's most advanced telephoto lens, featuring 21 elements including multiple ED, Super ED, and HR elements to minimize chromatic aberration. Image quality is exceptional throughout the zoom range with excellent sharpness and contrast even with the teleconverter engaged.

## Pros

- Extraordinary reach up to 1000mm equivalent
- Built-in teleconverter eliminates the need for external TCs
- Excellent sharpness and contrast
- Fast, accurate autofocus even at extreme focal lengths
- Superior weather sealing
- Well-balanced with good handling
- Sync IS provides incredible stabilization
- Lighter than full-frame equivalents

## Cons

- Very expensive (flagship pricing)
- Still heavy at 1875g
- Large and conspicuous
- Not ideal for handheld shooting for extended periods
- Requires substantial investment

## Real-World Performance

This lens excels for wildlife and bird photography, providing the reach professionals need. The 2x crop factor advantage of M43 really shines here - this lens matches the reach of a 300-800mm lens on full frame, or 375-1000mm with the TC, in a package that's significantly lighter and more affordable.

The stabilization system is phenomenal, allowing handheld shots at focal lengths where other systems would require a tripod. The built-in teleconverter is a game-changer, providing extra reach without image quality degradation.
