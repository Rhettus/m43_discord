## Overview

The Olympus 60mm f/2.8 Macro provides 1:1 life-size magnification (2:1 equivalent on full frame) in a compact, lightweight package. As a 120mm equivalent focal length, it doubles as an excellent portrait lens when not shooting macro work.

## Key Features

- True 1:1 macro capability
- 60mm (120mm equivalent) - perfect working distance
- Lightweight at just 185g
- Internal focusing design
- MSC autofocus system
- Weather-resistant construction
- Close-up photography from 19cm

## Optical Performance

Sharp from center to edge even at f/2.8, this lens delivers excellent detail rendition for macro work. Minimal chromatic aberration and distortion make it ideal for copying documents and detailed product photography as well.

## Pros

- True 1:1 macro in compact form
- Excellent sharpness and detail
- Good working distance for insects/flowers
- Doubles as portrait lens (120mm equiv)
- Lightweight and portable
- Weather-sealed
- Fast, silent autofocus

## Cons

- f/2.8 isn't super fast for low-light portraits
- Some vignetting at close distances
- Focus breathing present
- Competition from Panasonic's newer 30mm macro

## Real-World Performance

This lens excels at nature macro, product photography, and portraits. The 120mm equivalent focal length provides enough working distance to not scare away insects while avoiding the extreme magnification challenges of longer macro lenses.

Focus is fast and accurate, though manual focus override is often preferred for precise macro work. The weather sealing is a huge advantage when shooting in the field.
