## Overview

The Olympus M.Zuiko 45mm f/1.8 is often called the "nifty ninety" of the M43 system - a fast, sharp, compact portrait prime that delivers 90mm equivalent focal length at an incredibly affordable price. Released in 2011, it remains one of the best value lenses in the entire M43 lineup and a staple in many photographers' kits.

## Key Features

- **90mm equivalent** - Classic portrait focal length
- **Fast f/1.8 aperture** - Excellent low-light and subject isolation
- **Incredibly compact** - Only 46mm long, 116g weight
- **Sharp across the frame** - Excellent optical performance
- **MSC autofocus** - Fast and virtually silent
- **All-metal construction** - Premium build in a tiny package
- **37mm filter thread** - Compact filter size
- **Budget-friendly** - Often under $300
- **9 elements in 8 groups** including one ED element

## Pros

- Exceptional value - professional quality at budget price
- Very sharp from f/1.8, excellent by f/2.8
- Tiny and lightweight - barely notice it in your bag
- Fast, silent, accurate autofocus
- Beautiful bokeh and subject isolation
- Solid all-metal build quality
- Perfect portrait focal length (90mm equivalent)
- Versatile for street, portrait, and general use
- Minimal chromatic aberration
- Low distortion

## Cons

- Some vignetting at f/1.8 (easily corrected)
- Modest magnification (0.11x) limits close-up work
- Relatively long focal length can be tight indoors
- No weather sealing
- Lens hood sold separately
- Some sample variation reported
- Plastic lens cap feels cheap
- Not as "magic" as the 75mm f/1.8

## Image Quality

The 45mm f/1.8 delivers excellent image quality that far exceeds its budget price point. It's sharp across the frame from f/1.8, with center sharpness rivaling much more expensive lenses. Stopping down to f/2.8 makes it tack-sharp edge-to-edge.

**Sharpness**: Very good at f/1.8, excellent from f/2.8-f/5.6, slight diffraction limiting at f/8 and beyond. Center sharpness is outstanding across all apertures.

**Bokeh**: The 7-blade circular aperture produces pleasing, smooth bokeh. Not quite as creamy as the 75mm f/1.8, but still beautiful for subject isolation. Out-of-focus highlights are nicely rendered.

**Vignetting**: Noticeable at f/1.8 (about 1-1.5 stops in corners) but reduces significantly by f/2.8. Auto-corrected in-camera on most M43 bodies.

**Chromatic Aberration**: Very well controlled. Minimal lateral CA, some minor longitudinal CA (bokeh fringing) at wide apertures.

**Distortion**: Negligible barrel distortion, essentially straight lines.

## Performance

Autofocus is fast, accurate, and nearly silent thanks to MSC technology. It's not quite as fast as the newer PRO lenses, but more than adequate for general use including candid portraits and street photography.

The manual focus ring is smooth and responsive, though it's "by-wire" rather than mechanically coupled. Fine focus adjustment is straightforward.

## Build Quality

Despite its budget price, the 45mm f/1.8 features all-metal construction that feels solid and well-made. The lens barrel is metal, the mount is metal, and everything feels premium. At only 116g, it's remarkably light while still inspiring confidence.

The compact size (46mm long, 56mm diameter) makes it disappear on your camera. It's barely larger than a pancake lens but delivers far superior image quality.

**Note**: No weather sealing, but the solid construction should handle normal use without issues.

## Use Cases

**Perfect for:**
- Portrait photography (headshots, environmental portraits)
- Street photography (discreet, fast, sharp)
- Event photography (parties, gatherings)
- Low-light photography
- Travel photography (lightweight, versatile)
- General walkaround use
- Budget-conscious photographers wanting pro results
- First "fast prime" for kit lens users

**Less ideal for:**
- Indoor photography in very tight spaces
- Macro/close-up work (limited magnification)
- Wide environmental shots (too narrow)
- Video (some AF "wobble" reported on older cameras)

## Comparison to Alternatives

**vs. Olympus 75mm f/1.8:** The 75mm is sharper, has better bokeh, and more reach, but it's twice as heavy, three times more expensive, and too long for many indoor situations. The 45mm is more versatile.

**vs. Panasonic 25mm f/1.7:** The 25mm is wider (50mm equiv), slightly faster, and cheaper, making it better for general use and street. The 45mm is better for portraits with more compression and subject isolation.

**vs. Panasonic Leica 42.5mm f/1.2:** The Leica is faster (f/1.2), sharper, weather-sealed, and has better bokeh - but it's 4x the price and 3x the weight. The Olympus offers 90% of the performance at 25% of the cost.

**vs. Olympus 25mm f/1.8:** The 25mm (50mm equiv) is more versatile for everyday use, but the 45mm provides better portrait compression and background separation.

## "Nifty Ninety" Nickname

Just as full-frame systems have their "nifty fifty" (affordable 50mm f/1.8 lenses), the M43 system has the 45mm f/1.8 as its "nifty ninety" - the affordable, sharp, fast prime that every photographer should own.

> "The 45mm and 25mm f/1.8 lenses are the perfect one-two combo for everyday shooting." - Robin Wong

## Typical Use Pattern

Many M43 photographers adopt this pattern:
- **Olympus 25mm f/1.8** (50mm equiv) - General use, street, environmental
- **Olympus 45mm f/1.8** (90mm equiv) - Portraits, detail shots, compression
- **Zoom lens** (12-40mm or 12-100mm) - Versatility, landscapes

This combination covers most shooting scenarios while remaining incredibly lightweight and affordable.

## Sample Variation Note

Some online reports mention sample variation with this lens, particularly regarding decentering. While this appears uncommon, it's worth testing your copy when you receive it. Most copies are excellent.

## Final Thoughts

It's not perfect - the 75mm f/1.8 is sharper and has better bokeh, the 42.5mm f/1.2 is faster and weather-sealed - but for most photographers, the 45mm f/1.8 delivers 90% of the performance at a fraction of the cost and size. It's the lens that proves you don't need to spend big to get great results.

If you're entering the M43 system or looking to add your first fast prime, the 45mm f/1.8 should be at the top of your list. It's a lens you'll reach for constantly and never regret buying. Simply put, it's one of the all-time great M43 lenses.
