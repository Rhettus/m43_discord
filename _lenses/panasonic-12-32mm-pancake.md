## Overview

The Panasonic 12-32mm pancake zoom is one of the most compact zoom lenses ever made. Collapsing to just 24mm thick and weighing only 70g, it provides a useful 24-64mm equivalent range that makes your M43 camera truly pocketable.

## Key Features

- Incredibly compact collapsible design
- Ultra-lightweight at 70g
- Power zoom mechanism
- 12-32mm (24-64mm equivalent) range
- MEGA O.I.S. image stabilization
- Metal lens mount
- Affordable kit lens option

## Optical Performance

Surprisingly sharp for its size, especially in the center. Corners soften a bit at the extremes, and there's some vignetting wide open, but overall quality is good for such a compact zoom.

## Pros

- Truly pocketable with compact bodies
- Excellent price-to-performance ratio
- Built-in stabilization
- Sharp enough for most uses
- Perfect travel companion
- Minimal weight penalty

## Cons

- Slow variable aperture (f/3.5-5.6)
- Power zoom can feel unnatural
- Limited to 32mm on long end
- Plastic construction
- Extension required for use

## Real-World Performance

This is the lens that makes M43 shine as a travel system. Mounted on a compact body like the GX85 or E-M10, you get a tiny, capable system that fits in a jacket pocket. Image quality is more than adequate for travel photography, social media, and general use.

The power zoom works well for video but takes getting used to for still photography. The stabilization is effective and welcome given the relatively slow aperture.
