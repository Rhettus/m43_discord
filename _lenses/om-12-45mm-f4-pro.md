## Overview

The OM System 12-45mm f/4 PRO is the compact sibling to the famous 12-40mm f/2.8 PRO, offering similar focal length coverage in a significantly smaller and lighter package. At just 254g, it's one of the smallest PRO-series lenses while maintaining excellent optical quality and weather sealing.

## Key Features

- Compact 12-45mm range (24-90mm equivalent)
- Constant f/4 aperture
- Weather-sealed PRO construction
- Remarkably light at 254g
- Close focusing down to 12cm
- Fast, quiet MSC autofocus
- Metal lens mount
- Excellent build quality in a small form factor

## Optical Performance

Despite its compact size, this lens delivers sharp images across the frame with minimal distortion and aberrations. It may give up one stop to the 12-40mm f/2.8, but the optical quality is comparable while saving significant weight and bulk.

## Pros

- Incredibly compact for a PRO lens
- Sharp throughout the zoom range
- Weather-sealed construction
- Good close-focusing capability
- Well-balanced on smaller M43 bodies
- Perfect travel zoom
- Excellent value for PRO quality

## Cons

- One stop slower than 12-40mm f/2.8
- Lacks the extra 5mm reach of the 12-40mm
- Plastic barrel (though still well-built)
- No image stabilization (relies on IBIS)

## Real-World Performance

This is the ideal travel lens for photographers who prioritize portability. It pairs beautifully with compact bodies like the E-M5 series or OM-5, creating a weather-sealed system that fits in a small bag. The 24-90mm equivalent range covers most everyday shooting needs.

The close-focusing capability makes it surprisingly versatile for detail shots and near-macro work. While it's slower than the f/2.8 version, modern M43 sensors handle higher ISOs well, making this less of a limitation than it once was.
