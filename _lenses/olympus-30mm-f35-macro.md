## Overview

The Olympus 30mm f/3.5 Macro is the most compact 1:1 macro lens in the M43 system. At just 128g and 60mm equivalent focal length, it's perfect for tabletop photography, product shots, and casual macro work where you want minimal bulk.

## Key Features

- 1:1 life-size magnification capability
- Ultra-compact at 128g
- 30mm (60mm equivalent)
- Internal focusing
- MSC autofocus
- Minimum focus distance: 9.5cm
- Affordable entry to macro photography

## Optical Performance

Sharp in the center with good contrast, though edge performance softens slightly at close distances. More than adequate for most macro work where depth of field is shallow anyway.

## Pros

- Smallest 1:1 macro lens available
- Very affordable
- Lightweight and portable
- Good for product photography
- Fast autofocus
- No focus extension during focusing

## Cons

- Working distance quite short (60mm equiv)
- f/3.5 maximum aperture limits background blur
- Not weather-sealed
- Less useful as general-purpose lens compared to 60mm

## Real-World Performance

This lens shines for tabletop macro, product photography, and situations where you can control the subject distance. The short focal length means you need to get very close to subjects - great for still life, challenging for living creatures.

It's an excellent starter macro lens or complement to the 60mm for those wanting wider field of view macro capability.
