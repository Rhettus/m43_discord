## Overview

The Olympus M.Zuiko 75mm f/1.8 ED is widely considered one of the best lenses in the entire Micro Four Thirds system - a "legendary" lens that delivers 150mm equivalent focal length with exceptional sharpness and beautiful bokeh. Despite being released in 2012, it remains a benchmark for optical excellence and is the go-to portrait lens for professional M43 photographers.

## Key Features

- **Ultra-sharp** - Diffraction-limited from f/1.8, stops down beautifully
- **Fast f/1.8 aperture** - Excellent low-light performance
- **Premium all-metal construction** - Solid, professional build
- **150mm equivalent** - Perfect portrait focal length
- **9 circular aperture blades** - Smooth, creamy bokeh
- **10 elements in 9 groups** - 3 ED + 2 HR elements
- **MSC autofocus** - Fast, silent, and accurate
- **ZERO coating** - Excellent flare resistance
- **Close focus** - 84cm minimum distance
- **58mm filter thread** - Non-rotating

## Pros

- Exceptional sharpness corner-to-corner from f/1.8
- Beautiful, buttery smooth bokeh (foreground and background)
- Fast, silent, accurate autofocus
- Professional all-metal build quality
- Excellent color rendering and contrast
- Compact for a 150mm f/1.8 equivalent
- Perfect compression for portraits
- Outstanding value compared to full-frame equivalents
- Low distortion (0.44%)
- Minimal chromatic aberration

## Cons

- No weather sealing (despite premium build)
- Lens hood sold separately ($50-100)
- Relatively heavy for M43 (305g)
- Can feel front-heavy on smaller bodies
- Long focal length challenging in tight spaces
- Some bokeh fringing at f/1.8-f/2.8
- Price ($800-900) high for M43 system
- Front element reflects light unusually (cosmetic)

## Image Quality

This lens is simply stunning optically. DXOMark tested it as the best performing M43 lens in their entire database. It's ultra-sharp straight from f/1.8 and basically diffraction-limited, meaning stopping down doesn't significantly improve sharpness - it's already that good wide open.

**Sharpness**: Excellent center and edge sharpness at all apertures starting from f/1.8. By f/2.8, it's tack-sharp edge-to-edge. Many reviewers struggle to find differences in sharpness between f/2.8 and f/11.

**Bokeh**: The 9-blade circular aperture produces beautiful, creamy bokeh that's smooth in both foreground and background - a rare characteristic. Out-of-focus highlights are perfectly circular from f/1.8 to f/2.8. Some bokeh fringing (magenta/green halos) is visible at f/1.8-f/2.8 but minor at f/4.

**Vignetting**: Only 0.5EV at f/1.8, negligible beyond that. Auto-corrected in-camera on most M43 bodies.

**Chromatic Aberration**: Very low lateral CA. Some longitudinal CA (bokeh fringing) at wide apertures but well-controlled.

## Performance

Autofocus is near-instant on modern M43 bodies using MSC (Movie & Stills Compatible) technology. Focusing is silent, smooth, and highly accurate even in low light. On older pre-E-P3 bodies, AF is slower but still reliable.

Manual focus is "by-wire" but exceptionally well implemented with smooth, precise control that feels like a mechanical system.

## Build Quality

This is a premium lens with all-metal construction that feels substantial and well-built. At 305g, it's heavier than most M43 lenses but still compact compared to equivalent full-frame optics (Nikon 135mm f/2 DC weighs 815g).

The 58mm filter thread is large for M43 but standard for the system's premium lenses. The lens doesn't extend during focusing, making it perfect for polarizers and graduated filters.

**Note**: Despite premium build, there's no weather sealing - the only reason it's not designated "PRO."

## Lens Hood

The optional Olympus LH-61F hood is all-metal with a unique screw-in design (push and tighten with a screw). It's retro, protective, and reversible for storage, but costs $50-100 separately - a common complaint given the lens price.

## Use Cases

**Perfect for:**
- Portrait photography (indoor and outdoor)
- Event photography (weddings, parties)
- Theatre and indoor sports
- Low-light photography
- Professional work requiring shallow DOF
- Isolating subjects from busy backgrounds
- Candid photography at distance

**Less ideal for:**
- Indoor photography in tight spaces (too long)
- Street photography (reach may be excessive)
- Landscape photography (specialized use only)
- Close-up/macro work (0.1x magnification)

## Comparison to Alternatives

**vs. Panasonic Leica 42.5mm f/1.2:** The Panasonic is slightly shorter (85mm equiv vs 150mm), faster (f/1.2), and weather-sealed, but significantly more expensive and heavier. The Olympus offers more reach and is sharper.

**vs. Sigma 56mm f/1.4 DC DN:** The Sigma is shorter (112mm equiv), lighter, weather-sealed, focuses closer, and includes a hood - but isn't quite as sharp and lacks the Olympus's "magic."

**vs. Olympus 45mm f/1.8:** The 45mm is more versatile indoors, much smaller/lighter, and cheaper - but the 75mm is sharper, has better bokeh, and provides more compression.

**vs. Full-Frame 135-150mm f/1.8-f/2:** The Olympus delivers comparable results in a package 1/3 the size and weight at 1/6 the price.

## Depth of Field Note

While this is f/1.8, remember that M43 DOF behaves like 150mm f/3.6 on full-frame. This is still plenty shallow for portraits and subject isolation, but not as extreme as full-frame 135mm f/1.8.

## Community Reviews

> "This is probably the best lens I have ever owned. Despite being $900, it is an absolute bargain." - Photographer with 30+ years experience

> "Comparable (not equal) to the Nikon 200mm f/2.0 which is $5,600 and weighs 2.9kg." - Former Nikon shooter

> "Legendary. The quality and light-gathering of the optics had me using it professionally at weddings and events." - Professional event photographer

> "By quite a margin, the best micro-four-thirds lens that we have tested to date." - OpticalLimits

> "Ultra-sharp straight from f/1.8 and diffraction-limited." - Klaus Schroiff, PhotoZone

## Professional Use

Many professional photographers use this lens for:
- Wedding receptions (candids, first dances)
- Portrait sessions (seniors, engagements)
- Event photography (cocktail hours)
- Theatre and performance photography

The fast aperture keeps ISO low in dim venues, and the reach allows unobtrusive shooting.

## Body Pairing

**Best on**: OM-1, E-M1 series, E-M5 series, Panasonic G9/GH5 - professional bodies that balance the weight

**Works on**: Smaller bodies (E-PL series, GX series) but feels front-heavy. Consider a battery grip for better balance.

## Where to Buy

- New: $799-899
- Used: $500-700
- Frequently in stock at major retailers
- Hood: Olympus LH-61F or third-party alternatives

## Final Thoughts

The Olympus 75mm f/1.8 is a masterpiece. It's the lens that proves M43 can deliver professional-level portrait and event photography. Sharp from wide open, with beautiful bokeh and solid build quality, it's a lens you'll keep reaching for. The lack of weather sealing and separate hood purchase are minor quibbles in an otherwise exceptional package.

At $899, it's expensive for M43, but compared to full-frame alternatives (Canon 135mm f/2L at $1,100, Nikon 105mm f/1.4 at $2,200), it's an absolute bargain that delivers comparable results in a fraction of the size and weight. If you shoot portraits, events, or need a professional telephoto prime, this lens is simply a must-have.
