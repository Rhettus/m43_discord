## Overview

The OM System (formerly Olympus) 12-100mm f/4 PRO is widely considered the ultimate all-in-one lens for M43. With an incredible 8.3x zoom range (24-200mm equivalent), constant f/4 aperture, and exceptional image stabilization, this lens can handle virtually any shooting scenario.

## Key Features

- Extraordinary 12-100mm range (24-200mm equivalent)
- Constant f/4 aperture throughout the zoom range
- Advanced optical image stabilization works with in-body IS for up to 6.5 stops
- Weather-sealed construction (dustproof, splashproof, freezeproof)
- Minimum focusing distance of 15cm (5.9") across the entire zoom range
- Fast, silent autofocus with MSC mechanism
- High-grade PRO build quality with metal construction

## Optical Performance

LensTip's comprehensive review praised this lens highly, noting excellent image quality in the frame center and good edge performance at all focal lengths and apertures. The lens demonstrated minimal spherical aberration, moderate chromatic aberration, low coma, and well-controlled flare resistance.

## Pros

- Incredible versatility - genuinely eliminates lens changing
- Sharp across the entire frame and zoom range
- Excellent build quality and weather sealing
- Outstanding stabilization performance (Sync IS)
- Minimal distortion (auto-corrected in camera)
- Perfect travel lens - one lens does it all
- Can handhold at 1+ second exposures

## Cons

- Heavy for M43 standards at 561g (but light compared to full-frame equivalents)
- More expensive than typical M43 zooms
- f/4 maximum aperture limits low-light and bokeh potential
- Barrel distortion at wide end (though auto-corrected)

## Real-World Performance

This lens truly shines in the field. The combination of the huge zoom range and exceptional stabilization means you can capture everything from wide landscapes to distant subjects without carrying multiple lenses. The close focusing distance makes it surprisingly capable for near-macro work too.

Many photographers report this becoming their "only lens" - it's that versatile. The Sync IS system with compatible OM System bodies provides industry-leading stabilization that enables handheld shots at shutter speeds that would normally require a tripod.

> "At 100mm f/4, 5-Axis OIS is amazing. At the wide end, I can handhold at 1s or longer." - Discord user
