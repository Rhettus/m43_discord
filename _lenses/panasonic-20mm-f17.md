## Overview

The Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 is a legendary M43 lens - one of the first truly compact fast primes for the system. Providing a 40mm equivalent field of view, it's the perfect "normal" lens for street, documentary, and everyday photography.

## Key Features

- Fast f/1.7 maximum aperture
- 20mm (40mm equivalent) focal length
- Lightweight at 100g
- All-metal construction
- 7-blade aperture
- Affordable fast prime

## Optical Performance

Sharp from f/2.8 onward with good center sharpness even wide open. Corners improve significantly when stopped down. Some vignetting at f/1.7 but generally well-controlled. Chromatic aberration is minimal.

## Pros

- Excellent size-to-speed ratio
- Good optical quality for the price
- 40mm equiv is very versatile
- Metal construction feels premium
- Inconspicuous for street photography
- Classic rendering

## Cons

## Real-World Performance

This lens defined the M43 system's appeal as a compact, capable platform. The 40mm equivalent perspective is perfect for street photography, environmental portraits, and general photography. The fast aperture enables low-light shooting and subject separation.
