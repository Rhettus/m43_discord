## Welcome to Micro Four Thirds!

Micro Four Thirds (M43) is a mirrorless camera system that offers an excellent balance between image quality, portability, and affordability. This guide will help you understand what makes M43 special and how to get started.

## What is Micro Four Thirds?

M43 is an open standard created by Olympus and Panasonic in 2008. The key features include:

- **Smaller sensor size** (17.3 x 13mm) compared to full-frame or APS-C
- **2x crop factor** - a 25mm lens provides a 50mm equivalent field of view
- **Compact lenses and bodies** thanks to the smaller sensor and shorter flange distance
- **Excellent in-body stabilization** (IBIS) on most camera bodies
- **Wide lens selection** from multiple manufacturers

## Why Choose M43?

### Advantages

- **Portability**: Significantly smaller and lighter than full-frame systems
- **Affordable**: Generally less expensive than comparable full-frame gear
- **Lens Selection**: Huge variety of native lenses from Olympus, Panasonic, and third parties
- **Video Features**: Many M43 cameras are video powerhouses (GH series)
- **IBIS**: Industry-leading image stabilization
- **Depth of Field**: More forgiving for beginners, easier to keep subjects in focus

### Considerations

- **Low Light**: Smaller sensor means more noise at high ISOs compared to full-frame
- **Background Blur**: Harder to achieve extreme shallow depth of field
- **Dynamic Range**: Slightly less than larger sensors

## Your First M43 Camera

### Budget Options ($300-600 used)
- Panasonic G85
- Olympus E-M10 Mark III
- Panasonic G9 (used)

### Mid-Range ($800-1200)
- Olympus E-M5 Mark III
- Panasonic G9 II
- Olympus E-M1 Mark II (used)

### Professional ($1500+)
- OM System OM-1
- Panasonic GH6
- Olympus E-M1 Mark III

## Essential Lenses to Start

### The "Kit Lens" Approach
Most cameras come with a 14-42mm kit lens. This is great for learning, but consider upgrading to:

**Olympus 12-40mm f/2.8 PRO** or **Panasonic 12-35mm f/2.8**
- Better image quality
- Faster aperture
- Weather sealing
- Great all-around lens

### The "Prime Lens" Approach
Start with one or two fast primes:

**For everyday shooting**: 25mm f/1.8 (Olympus or Panasonic)
- 50mm equivalent
- Fast aperture
- Compact
- Affordable ($250-350)

**For portraits**: 45mm f/1.8 (Olympus) or 42.5mm f/1.7 (Panasonic)
- 90mm equivalent
- Beautiful bokeh
- Perfect for portraits

## Settings for Beginners

### Start with Aperture Priority Mode (A/Av)
- You control aperture (f-stop)
- Camera controls shutter speed
- Adjust ISO manually or use Auto ISO

### Key Settings to Learn
1. **ISO**: Start at 200, increase in low light
2. **Aperture**: f/2.8-f/5.6 for general shooting
3. **Focus Mode**: Single AF for static subjects, Continuous AF for moving subjects
4. **IBIS**: Keep it on for sharper handheld shots
5. **Image Stabilization**: Use it! M43 IBIS is excellent

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Obsessing Over Sensor Size
Don't get caught up in the "full-frame vs M43" debate. M43 is capable of professional results in most situations.

### Mistake 2: Buying Too Many Lenses Too Soon
Master one or two lenses before expanding your kit. Quality over quantity.

### Mistake 3: Not Using IBIS Properly
Learn how to use image stabilization effectively. It's one of M43's biggest advantages.

### Mistake 4: Shooting Everything Wide Open
While f/1.8 is tempting, sometimes f/4 or f/5.6 gives better results with more sharpness and depth of field.

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **Learn Manual Mode** - Full creative control
2. **Study Composition** - Rule of thirds, leading lines, etc.
3. **Experiment with Different Focal Lengths** - Rent or borrow lenses
4. **Join the Community** - Connect with other M43 shooters on forums and Discord
5. **Practice, Practice, Practice** - The best camera is the one you use
